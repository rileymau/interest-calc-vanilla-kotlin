# interest-calc-vanilla-kotlin

An engine calculating principal, interest rate, time periods, and total
interest.  

The user can provide 3 out of those 4 items, and the app will calculate
the missing info.  

## Tech stack

This repository uses Kotlin and Gradle.  

I used ChatGPT 4o while building this project to help with Kotlin syntax.
The formulas I derived on my own.  

## Local setup

`brew install kotlin`
`brew install gradle`

### Build

Clone the repo, then:

```shell
cd interest-calc
./gradlew build
```

### Run

Run using the happy green arrow in IntelliJ
(More to come)

Thanks for trying out my compound interest app!
